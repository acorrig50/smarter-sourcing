The idea is to create a website that can take user input (a clothing item and brand), scrape ebay and return turnover for:
    1. best match search
    2. low to high + shipping search
    3. High to low + shipping search
    4. new listed search

Taking the results from each search, the user can then decide which turnover best reflects the items sellability. 

WHERE WILL IT RUN? 
Run it off of a rasberry pi hosted on my own personal network.
